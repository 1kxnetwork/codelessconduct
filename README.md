# Codeless Conduct

The open web is rapidly growing, increasing the need for contributors from all fields and backgrounds. Codeless Conduct is an event to learn and experiment with all things web3, by deep-diving into different protocols and completing no-code bounties.

Participants will engage with a passionate community of like-minded creators who are driven by the desire to shape the future of this space.

Regardless of your skill set - let's get inspired, share ideas, and celebrate web3 culture together!

‚ÄçOur goal is to gather a collective of curious, creatives, artists, users, writers, and thinkers to learn from each others' unique perspectives. Our mission is to make this space as inclusive as possible.
